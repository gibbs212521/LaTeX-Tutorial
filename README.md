# LaTeX-Tutorial
A series of tutorials on LaTeX intended for undergrad Electrical Engineering Students

{Work in Progress}

Addendum Note: 4 years later.
I shall begin building out this tutorial set as I have returned to using LaTeX in a professional context
in automating portions of my work.

We all make reports, and some of us prefer to let our text documents do math for us.
Even fewer of us prefer to let our text documents make pretty info-graphics for us.
I want to help others increase our number.


To Do List:
.sty files
javascript meets LaTeX
TeX vs LaTeX
Directories
Functionalizing LaTeX
Mathematics in LaTeX
Automation in LaTeX
